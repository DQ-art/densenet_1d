# densenet_1d

This repository contains a Keras implementation of the DenseNet paper (Huang et al, "Densely Connected Convolutional Networks", CVPR 2017). This implementation will focus on use-cases where the inputs are 1D sequences. 

# Setup
To install densenet, simply clone this repository, and run
```
python setup.py install
```

# Usage

The classifiers directory contains classifiers implemented as subclasses of `keras.models.Model` classes. This means that once a `densenet.classifier` is instantiated, it contains all of the usual methods of `keras.models.Model`, such as `fit`, `predict`, `evaluate`, `summary`, etc.

Here is an instantiation of the model that matches the original Huang et al. paper, except using a one-dimensional input rather than a two-dimensional input:

```python

from densenet.classifiers.one_d import DenseNet121
model = DenseNet121((224, 10), 1000, 5, 3, 4, 2, 2, .5, 7, 2, 10, 3, 2)
print(model.summary())
```
Upon running those lines, you should see an extensive summary indicating the layers in the model.
